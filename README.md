# MyFridge: Eliminating Food Waste

## Overview

MyFridge is a web application designed to tackle the issue of food waste, a pervasive problem contributing to environmental and economic challenges. Through a user-friendly interface, MyFridge helps users make the most of their ingredients by suggesting recipes based on items close to expiration.

## The Food Waste Epidemic

Each year, 119 billion pounds of food is wasted in the United States, equivalent to 130 billion meals and over $408 billion worth of discarded food. Tristram Stuart, a food activist, aptly states, "We are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats."

### Where Does the Food Go?

- 60% of food in America is consumed.
- 26% is wasted in our homes.
- 30% is wasted commercially.
